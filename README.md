This is my first project using HTML/CSS.
While it is very simplistic, I worked to recreate the Google homepage to gain an understanding of how HTML and CSS work and to build basic skills in front-end development. The site isn't functional, but through this project I learned just how much work goes into building the front end of websites and how to go about it.
